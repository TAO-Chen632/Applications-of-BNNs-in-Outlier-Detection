# Applications-of-BNNs-in-Outlier-Detection
This Github repository contains the data files (the .csv files) and Python code (the .ipynb file) for the paper "Applications of Bayesian Neural Networks in Outlier Detection".  
I try to fix the random seed when conducting the experiments. However, because the operation systems and the versions of the packages vary, the results may still be discrepant (but will be similar) when the code is run by different people or at different time. Moreover, the package `edward2` does not provide the function to fix random seeds, and so the outcomes of the experiment on Taxi dataset cannot be strictly fixed.  
The HTML and PDF files are rendered versions of the Python code, which could be regarded as a reference standard for the experimental results.
